## What is Angry Syrians ?

Angry Syrians is a parody version of Angry Birds. Instead of having birds you have bombs that you can send on Assad and his thugs. It was never meant to be a commercial game. Just a fun side project coded in less than 6 hours.

But Angry Syrians is not only about Syria. You could just replace the artwork and use it for whatever theme you want. After the

or 

>I totally need to Storify this

 it could just become

>We need to Angrify this 

## Why Angry Syrians ?

### How it started ...

It all started while chatting with [a friend](https://twitter.com/#!/noneinhere) and seeing [this meme](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=179880925465714). She challenged me to code it. And I accepted the challenge.

### Motivation behind it

If you know me you probably noticed that I'm a hacktivist. I think the web can really make this world a better place. The revolution in Syria started over a year ago and every days hundreds die.

Countries don't believe the stakes are high enough to risk an intervention. So Assad is doing what he wants in Syria without anyone daring to make an intervention.

The topic has already been widely covered using  social media but since it's lasting so long it isn't trending on Twitter anymore. People just got used to it and this is unacceptable.

You may ask how this project may help the Syrian cause. It's all about education. Whatever you'll be doing with this code keep in mind that it was originally designed made to educate people about [what's going on in Syria](https://twitter.com/#!/JanKuzvart/syria).

## Technical Information

This game was build exclusively for the iPhone. It runs on the iPad though but isn't optimized yet. It was build using a graphics library called [Cocos-2D](http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/). An Android port is difficult since the whole code is in Objective-C. 

## Next Steps

I would love writing a small "Get Started" software to turn anything in an Angry-Bird game. I would also love getting some decent artwork. I'm not an artist. I'm a programmer and the design of the game really sucks. By allowing anyone to make a Angry-Bird game I really hope the creative minds of this world will take over and build some awesome stuff with it.

I would also love improving the way the High Score is computed because it's really buggy right now.

I'm also open to any contributions on this project. All my code is copy-left so feel free to steal it.
